# Native Features App

This Flutter app allows users to capture photos of their favorite places, add locations either by using their current location or by selecting on a map, and store this information in local storage using the `sqflite` package. This app is a great way to keep track of memorable places and store them for future reference.

## Features

- **Capture Photos:** Users can take pictures of their favorite places directly within the app.
- **Add Location:** Users can add the location of the place either by using their current GPS location or by manually selecting the location on a map.
- **Local Storage:** All data, including the photo and location, is stored locally on the device using the `sqflite` package, ensuring that the app works offline.
- **View Saved Places:** Users can view a list of all the places they've saved, including the photo and location details.
